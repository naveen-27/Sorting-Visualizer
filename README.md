# Sorting Visualizer

Fascinated by sorting algorithms and their humongous part in almost every software that is written, I have come up with a Sorting Visualizer that enables a newbie to understand the full functionality of a sorting algorithm.

An integer array that keeps manipulating one step a time dictated as per user convenience is a major highlight.

Use Google Chrome (or) Mozilla Firefox from a desktop computer.

If you want to locally run this,
              -> make sure to clone/download the repository
              -> open index.html using a localhost server
